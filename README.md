# camp-shooter
A simple shooter written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Just another beginners project :)

If you want to try this project, you need a server which receives messages via WebSockets and broadcasts them to all connected players.
The sample server is `https://pchat.day4.live` which is privately hosted and might not be up when you try this code.
